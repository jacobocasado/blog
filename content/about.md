Hello! I am **Jaco**. I love computers and technology in general, and I am currently working as a Cyber Security Evaluator at [jtsec Beyond IT Security](https://www.jtsec.es/es). I created this blog as a way to store my knowledge (my memory is not the best) and as a way to display some of the knowledge I am learning over the time. 

In my job, my main expertise field is **web application pentesting**, but I have also evaluated mobile applications and EDRs and I am not scared to learn more about new frameworks, methodologies, tools or systems.

Although this blog is not for a specific topic, I will mainly cover **malware development and OS internals** topics as they are the main topic I like to study when I am not working at my job. In the future, I would like to develop a course covering these topics.

Navigate to the [Posts](../posts) section to see all of my work in this platform; you can also contact me in my socials by clicking at the icons on the top.

See you!

*jaco*
